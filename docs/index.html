This dashboard aims to understand how our consumption of seafood relates
to food supply chains - what is being produced, what is imported and
exported, and how does this relate to what we eat and what we should be
eating for optimal health. This knowledge will help to reconsider
national food supply chains, but also ensure that current national
dietary guidelines take into account consumer health outcomes, as well
as food supplies and the sustainability of food production systems.

### Table 1 Data availablitiy

Table 1 shows which commodity data is available for which species in the seafood database.The Seafood data base contains a decade worth (2009 - 2020) of data for 88 marine species. When the data availability is __"No"__ it indicates that the data is either not captured, not available to us or is not relevant for the respective species, e.g. not every species can be farmed in aquaculture.
